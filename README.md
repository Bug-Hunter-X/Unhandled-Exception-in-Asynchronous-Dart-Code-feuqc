# Unhandled Exception in Asynchronous Dart Code

This repository demonstrates a common error in asynchronous Dart code and its solution.  The `bug.dart` file contains code that fetches data from an API. However, error handling is incomplete. The `bugSolution.dart` file provides an improved version with proper exception handling using `try-catch` and `rethrow`.
